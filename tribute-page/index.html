          Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (<i>née</i> Byron), also known
          as Ada Lovelace, was a 19th-century mathematician and writer known
          for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose
          computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what
          is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a
          machine. As such, she is often regarded as the first computer
          programmer.

          Lovelace had a profound vision of the capabilities of computing beyond
          mere number-crunching—she imagined machines that could manipulate
          symbols and create music or art. This conceptual leap was not fully
          appreciated until the modern computing era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programming language <i>Ada</i> (first appeared in february 1980) is named after her, honoring her
          contributions to the field of computing.
